BISMALLAH

This folder is intended to be the directory where I play around with certain functions of OpenCV to learn about how they work.

There are files that are in C++ and in Python3, the main program is going to hopefully be in C++ (since it is cooler) but it could also possibly be in Python3


There are many ups and downs for making the program in Python3, it is easier to read, easier to code and mostly less hastle. The thing is that it is slow and in an UNO game speed is an important element to win the game whilst also prosessing the best outcome for each decision.

As of now, the intention for the main project is that it is done in C++, this does not mean that their may not be a copy of the same algorithm within the Python3 language. A subsequent copy of this algorithm shall be produced within a resonable time after the original C++ algorithm is created. The C++ algorithim may require more time, as again, I need to study the OpenCV library.

Thanks to you all!
